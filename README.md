# PotluckAdventures.Spring

This was a 3 day project to come up with a Blog Website that users can post on about their favorite Potlucks. I thought this was great idea
because I LOVE FOOD!! Especially free food!!! 

Posts your blogs about the best buffet or potluck you been to or going to here: https://blogpost-project1.herokuapp.com/

I used Spring Boot/Spring MVC to create this Blog Web Page with a little BootStrap/CSS
